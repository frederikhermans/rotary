# Raspberry Pi-powered Rotary Phone

## Usage

Hook up rotary dialer to GPIO pins 2 (movement indicator) and 3 (pulse
indicator). Attach earpiece to the headphone jack.

Create a `sounds/` subdirectory and populate it with sound files. If
there's a file called 258844.mp3, it will be called when 258844 is
dialed.
